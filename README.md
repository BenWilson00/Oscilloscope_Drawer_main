# Oscilloscope_Drawer_main
Drawing program for oscilloscopes.

This is a program for sketching out the points in a trace,
which will then be written to an arduino file,
which outputs varying PWM-analogue signals for both x and y,
which is connected to an oscilloscope,
which then traces this image/animation from the file.
At least, that's the plan.

It works on the old version, however I have been working on a newer version with many more features, including animation.
