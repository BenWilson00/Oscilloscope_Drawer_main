# Oscilloscope_Drawer_main
Drawing program for oscilloscopes.

This is a program for sketching out the points in a trace,
which is then written to an arduino file,
which outputs varying PWM-analogue signals for both x and y,
which is connected to an oscilloscope,
which then traces the image/animation from the file.

This was a side project while I was at school, and I currently don't have any screenshots of its final state.
